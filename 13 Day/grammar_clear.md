### Python code that uses the `language_tool_python` library to identify and correct grammar mistakes in sentences. You can install the library using `pip install language-tool-python`.

```python
import language_tool_python

def correct_grammar(sentence):
    # Initialize the LanguageTool object
    tool = language_tool_python.LanguageTool('en-US')  # Specify the language (English - US)
    
    # Check for grammar mistakes in the sentence
    matches = tool.check(sentence)
    
    # Correct the mistakes
    corrected_sentence = language_tool_python.utils.correct(sentence, matches)
    
    return corrected_sentence

# Example usage
input_sentence = "He go to the market yesterday and buy some vegetable."
corrected = correct_grammar(input_sentence)

print("Original Sentence: ", input_sentence)
print("Corrected Sentence: ", corrected)
```

### Output:
---
Original Sentence: He go to the market yesterday and buy some vegetable.  
Corrected Sentence: He went to the market yesterday and bought some vegetables.
