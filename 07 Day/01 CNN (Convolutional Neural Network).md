# CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

### **1. Introduction to CNNs**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks that are particularly effective for analyzing visual imagery. They use a mathematical operation called convolution, which allows them to efficiently process data in a grid-like topology, such as images.

#### **1.1 Key Components of CNNs**
- **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply a number of filters to the input. Each filter extracts different features from the input image, such as edges, colors, or textures.
- **Activation Function**: Typically, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is used to introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns.
- **Pooling Layers**: These layers reduce the dimensions of the data by combining the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer. Max pooling is the most common technique.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connected layers. Neurons in a fully connected layer have connections to all activations in the previous layer.

### **2. Setting Up the Environment**

To run the example, you'll need Python installed, along with libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

### **3. A Simple CNN Example: Image Classification with MNIST**

The MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, is commonly used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

#### **3.1 Loading the Data**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
```

#### **3.2 Preprocessing the Data**

Before training, the data must be reshaped and normalized:

```python
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1))
train_images = train_images.astype('float32') / 255  # Normalize to 0-1

test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28, 28, 1))
test_images = test_images.astype('float32') / 255  # Normalize to 0-1
```

#### **3.3 Building the CNN Model**

Hereâ€™s how to define a simple CNN model using Keras:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))  # 10 because MNIST has 10 classes (0 to 9)
```

#### **3.4 Compiling the Model**

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

#### **3.5 Training the Model**

```python
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64)
```

#### **3.6 Evaluating the Model**

```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_acc}")
```

### **4. Conclusion and Further Steps**

This simple CNN has been trained to classify MNIST images with high accuracy. Experiment with different architectures, more or fewer convolutional layers, changes in filter sizes, or more epochs to see how these changes affect performance.
