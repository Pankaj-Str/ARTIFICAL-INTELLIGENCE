## What is a Neuron?

A **neuron** is a **basic unit that receives, processes, and sends information**.

It exists in two forms:

1. **Biological Neuron** – found in the human brain
2. **Artificial Neuron** – used in Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks

---

## 1. Biological Neuron (Human Brain)

A biological neuron is a **nerve cell** that helps humans think, learn, and remember.

### Main parts of a biological neuron:

* **Dendrites** – receive signals
* **Cell Body** – processes signals
* **Axon** – sends signals to other neurons

### Example:

When you touch something hot:

```
Skin → Neuron → Brain → Hand moves back
```

## 2. Artificial Neuron (In AI & Machine Learning)

An **artificial neuron** is a **mathematical model inspired by the human brain**.
It is the **building block of Neural Networks**.

### What does an artificial neuron do?

It:

* Takes input values
* Applies weights
* Adds bias
* Uses an activation function
* Produces an output

## Working of an Artificial Neuron (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Inputs

Inputs are numbers (data)

```
x1, x2, x3
```

### Step 2: Weights

Each input has a weight

```
w1, w2, w3
```

### Step 3: Weighted Sum

```
z = (x1×w1) + (x2×w2) + (x3×w3) + bias
```

### Step 4: Activation Function

The activation function decides whether the neuron should “fire” or not.

```
output = activation(z)
```

---

## Simple Example (Artificial Neuron)

Suppose:

```
x1 = 2,  w1 = 0.5
x2 = 3,  w2 = 0.4
bias = 1
```

Calculation:

```
z = (2×0.5) + (3×0.4) + 1
z = 1 + 1.2 + 1
z = 3.2
```

After activation → Output is generated.

## Common Activation Functions

* **Step Function**
* **Sigmoid**
* **ReLU**
* **Tanh**

---

## Neuron in Neural Network

* One neuron → simple decision
* Many neurons → neural network
* Many layers → deep learning

---

## Real-Life Example

* **Spam Email Detection**
* **Face Recognition**
* **Voice Assistants**

All use millions of artificial neurons.
